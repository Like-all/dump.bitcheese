<p>
This file have been not requested for a long time and have been placed into cold storage. It is being thawed since <%= @thaw_request.created_at %> and 
<%
	distance = Settings.average_thawing_time.to_i.hours - (DateTime.now - @thaw_request.created_at.to_datetime)*24*3600
  if distance > 0
  %>
will be available in approximately <%= distance_of_time_in_words(distance) %>. Please check back then.
<% else %>
	should  already be here... weird.
<% end %>
</p>

<p> If file is still not available by then, please <a href="<%= Settings.contact_url %>">report the issue</a>. </p>
